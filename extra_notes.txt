mAP on TF2.x
You need to run the model_main_tf2.py script in two shells simultaneously.

In the first shell, you run it with arguments --model_dir and --pipeline_config_path, for training, like below:

python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir my-model --pipeline_config_path my-model/pipeline.config --alsologtostderr
In the second shell, you need to pass an extra argument called --checkpoint_dir, pointing to the folder where checkpoints are stored, like below:

python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir my-model --pipeline_config_path my-model/pipeline.config --checkpont_dir my-model
This will trigger evaluation mode of the script, and TensorBoard will start to show mAP and recall metrics.
